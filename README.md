#Boba Shop Games: Quick Think
This application lets users play a game called "Quick Think." Users will be able to create teams and set a target score goal. Users will have a limited amount of time to give three answers to fairly simple question. The pressure of coming up with answers within the short time frame is where the game gets exciting.
